# Fashion Generative Studio

A complete hands-on project for building and comparing Generative AI models (VAE and GAN) on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

Fashion Generative Studio is an educational project designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice in Generative AI. It implements two major generative paradigms:

1. **Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)**: Learns structured latent representations for reconstruction and generation.
2. **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: Optimized for high-fidelity image generation through adversarial competition.

## Project Structure

The project follows a 5-phase workflow:

- **Phase 1: Environment & Data Preparation**: Setting up PyTorch pipes and Fashion-MNIST dataloaders.
- **Phase 2: Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)**: Implementing and training the VAE model.
- **Phase 3: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: Building a DCGAN architecture for fashion image generation.
- **Phase 4: Evaluation and Comparison**: Quantitatively comparing models using an evaluator classifier.
- **Phase 5: Generative Playground**: Interactive demo using Jupyter Widgets.

## Installation & Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # For PyTorch version
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib ipywidgets nbformat

   # For Keras/TensorFlow version
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib ipywidgets nbformat
   ```

3. Open your preferred notebook:

   ```bash
   # Option 1: PyTorch
   jupyter notebook Hands_On_Project_on_Generative_Models_online_G1.ipynb

   # Option 2: Keras/TensorFlow
   jupyter notebook Hands_On_Project_on_Generative_Models_Keras.ipynb
   ```

## Model Details

### VAE

- **Architecture**: Convolutional-based (CNN) Encoder/Decoder for improved spatial feature extraction.
- **Latent Space**: 20-dimensional.
- **Training**: Optimized for 10 epochs.
- **Loss**: Reconstruction (BCE) + KL Divergence.

### GAN (DCGAN)

- **Architecture**: Deep Convolutional Generator/Discriminator.
- **Latent Noise**: 100-dimensional.
- **Training**: Optimized for 15 epochs.
- **Loss**: Binary Cross Entropy (Adversarial).

## Outputs

Generated images and visualizations are produced directly in the notebook, including:

- **Real Samples**: Reference grid of official dataset images.
- **VAE Reconstructions**: Comparative grid of original vs. reconstructed fashion items.
- **GAN Samples**: Unique items generated by the trained DCGAN.
- **Loss Curves**: Visualization of training stability for both models.

## Results & Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on:

- **Visual Quality**: Comparing the sharpness of DCGAN outputs against the structured reconstructions of the VAE.
- **Classification Confidence**: A separate CNN `Evaluator` network measures the "realness" of generated samples by identifying their fashion category.
