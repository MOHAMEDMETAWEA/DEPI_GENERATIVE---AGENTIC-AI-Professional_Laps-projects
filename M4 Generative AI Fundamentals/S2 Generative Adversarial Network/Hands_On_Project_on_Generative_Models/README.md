# Fashion Generative Studio

A complete hands-on project for building and comparing Generative AI models (VAE and GAN) on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

Fashion Generative Studio is an educational project designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice in Generative AI. It implements two major generative paradigms:

1. **Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)**: Learns structured latent representations for reconstruction and generation.
2. **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: Optimized for high-fidelity image generation through adversarial competition.

## Project Structure

The project follows a 5-phase workflow:

- **Phase 1: Environment & Data Preparation**: Setting up PyTorch pipes and Fashion-MNIST dataloaders.
- **Phase 2: Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)**: Implementing and training the VAE model.
- **Phase 3: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: Building a DCGAN architecture for fashion image generation.
- **Phase 4: Evaluation and Comparison**: Quantitatively comparing models using an evaluator classifier.
- **Phase 5: Generative Playground**: Interactive demo using Jupyter Widgets.

## Key Files

- `Hands_On_Project_on_Generative_Models_online_G1.ipynb`: The main project notebook containing all implementation phases.
- `fashion_studio.py`: A standalone script version of the complete pipeline (useful for background training).
- `studio_outputs/`: Directory containing generated samples and visualizations.
- `update_notebook.py`: Utility script used to populate the notebook programmatically.

## Installation & Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib ipywidgets nbformat
   ```

3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Hands_On_Project_on_Generative_Models_online_G1.ipynb
   ```

## Model Details

### VAE

- **Architecture**: MLP-based Encoder/Decoder.
- **Latent Space**: 20-dimensional.
- **Loss**: Reconstruction (BCE) + KL Divergence.

### GAN (DCGAN)

- **Architecture**: Convolutional Generator/Discriminator.
- **Latent Noise**: 100-dimensional.
- **Loss**: Binary Cross Entropy (Adversarial).

## Outputs

Generated images are saved in the `studio_outputs/` folder, including:

- `real_samples.png`: Reference grid of official dataset images.
- `vae_samples.png`: Images generated from the VAE latent space.
- `gan_samples.png`: Images generated by the trained Generator.

## Results & Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on:

- **Visual Quality**: GANs typically produce sharper images, while VAEs produce smoother reconstructions.
- **Classification Confidence**: An evaluator network measures how identifiable the generated fashion items are.
