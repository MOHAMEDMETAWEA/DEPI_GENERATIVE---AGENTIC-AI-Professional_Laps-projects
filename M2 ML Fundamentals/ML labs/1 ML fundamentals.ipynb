It is designed for beginner-to-intermediate students to understand the core idea, when to use the model, and what to expect.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 1.  **Linear Regression**\n","### **Purpose**\n","Predict a continuous value using a linear relationship.\n","\n","### **Core Idea**\n","Fits a straight line to data by minimizing error.\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Numerical predictions (prices, scores, temperature).\n","- When relationship is roughly linear.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Simple, fast, interpretable.\n","- Works well with small data.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Struggles with nonlinear patterns.\n","- Sensitive to outliers.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. **Logistic Regression**\n","### **Purpose**\n","Binary or multi-class classification.\n","\n","### **Core Idea**\n","Estimates the probability of a class using the logistic function.\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Classification like spam/not spam.\n","- When classes are linearly separable.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Interpretable.\n","- Fast to train.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Limited to linear boundaries.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. **KNN — K-Nearest Neighbors**\n","### **Purpose**\n","Classification or regression.\n","\n","### **Core Idea**\n","Predicts based on the closest points in the dataset.\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Small datasets.\n","- When decision boundary is irregular.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- No training stage.\n","- Simple and intuitive.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Slow in prediction.\n","-

the data into smaller subsets based on rules.\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Features are a mix (numeric + categorical).\n","- Need explainability.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Easy to interpret.\n","- Handles nonlinear data.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Very prone to overfitting.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5.  **Random Forest**\n","### **Purpose**\n","Ensemble of Decision Trees.\n","\n","### **Core Idea**\n","Builds many trees and averages their predictions.\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Need strong baseline model.\n","- Tabular data with many features.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Reduces overfitting.\n","- Great performance in most datasets.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Less interpretable.\n","- Training can be slow on large datasets.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost)**\n","### **Purpose**\n","High-performance ensemble method.\n","\n","### **Core Idea**\n","Builds trees one by one; each new tree fixes errors of previous ones.\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Competitions and production systems.\n","- Complex tabular data.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Often state-of-the-art.\n","- Handles missing data well (CatBoost).\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Requires tuning.\n","- Can overfit if not regularized.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7.  **SVM — Support

datasets.\n","- High-dimensional spaces.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Works well in complex feature spaces.\n","- Robust to overfitting.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Slow with big data.\n","- Hard to tune.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8.  **Naive Bayes**\n","### **Purpose**\n","Classification, especially text.\n","\n","### **Core Idea**\n","Uses probability and assumes “feature independence.”\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Spam detection.\n","- Text classification.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Extremely fast.\n","- Works well even with limited data.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Independence assumption is unrealistic.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 9.  **K-Means Clustering**\n","### **Purpose**\n","Unsupervised clustering.\n","\n","### **Core Idea**\n","Groups data based on similarity.\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Customer segmentation.\n","- Pattern discovery.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Simple and scalable.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Needs predefined number of clusters.\n","- Sensitive to outliers.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 10.  **PCA — Principal Component Analysis**\n","### **Purpose**\n","Dimensionality reduction.\n","\n","### **Core Idea**\n","Finds directions of maximum variance.\n","\n","### **When to Use**\n","- Visualization of high-dimensional data.\n","- Preprocessing for ML models.\n","\n","### **Strengths**\n","- Reduces noise.\n","- Speeds up training.\n","\n","### **Weaknesses**\n","- Harder to interpret transformed features.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Final Notes\n","- Always **scale your features** for SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, PCA.\n","- Use **cross-validation** to reduce overfitting.\n","- Try a **baseline model** first (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).\n","- For tabular data: **Gradient Boosting is usually best**.\n","- For text data: start with **Naive Bayes**, then upgrade.\n","- For clustering: use **K-Means**, but test different K values."],"metadata":{"id":"17-D5e3_boml"},"id":"17-D5e3_boml"},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"c1_hJqgKbqeq"},"id":"c1_hJqgKbqeq","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a520ab40","metadata":{"id":"a520ab40"},"source":["#
