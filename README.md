## 🚀 How to Use

As this is a journey, the notebooks are designed to be self-contained within their respective folders.

1. **Explore Modules:** Navigate to the folder of interest.
2. **Setup Environment:** Each module may have specific requirements. A general environment with `jupyter`, `torch`/`tensorflow`, and `transformers` is recommended.
3. **Run Labs:** Open the `.ipynb` files to see implementations and complete the practical assignments.
